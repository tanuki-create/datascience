# Problem 7: Valid Anagram

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "listen", t = "silent"
Output: true
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "ab"
Output: false
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Follow-up
What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
