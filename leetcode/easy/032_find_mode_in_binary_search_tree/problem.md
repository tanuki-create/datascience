# Problem 32: Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the **mode(s)** (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
